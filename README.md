# What I used
* ELEGOO Uno R3 (Arduino Uno R3 clone) (The brains ðŸ§ )
* VL53L0X Distance Sensor (To measure your finger's position ðŸŽ¯)
* OLED I2C 128x64 Screen (To display the note and distance ðŸ“Ÿ)
* Passive Buzzer (To play the notes ðŸŽµ)
* Breadboard and a lot of wires
* And many household items to put it all together such as cardboard, tape, and even a sock.
